# Lfds test with LazyCseq

A set of tests with LazyCseq of the famous lock-free C library LFDS.  

## Repository Structure

- *lazy-cseq2.0*: lazy-cseq code
- *liblfds7.1.1*: lfds library code
- *workspace*: a bunch of c testfiles

## Workspace note

In this directory you will file a set of directories with some simple C example programs, provided with a Makefile to make them easier to compile and test.  
All makefiles have a **preprocessed** target to expand macro and make the programs easier to debug.

## Workflow
- [x] Simulate fence
- [] Make manual test case
- [] Automatize test case
- [] Valutate benchmark
